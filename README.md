# SingleLine
An app to test different methods gesture monitoring.

I made this app to explore ways of monitoring a user's gestures.
It was an early exercise in the development of another app called Recreate where we were intending to interrupt a user when it looks like
they're mindlessly scrolling a social media feed.

Future tests of the app include having a user log in to a web version of a social media app to see if Single Line can then monitor their gestures.
Each view is a different method of illustrating what the user is doing/ or provides a different indicator of the behavior.

I wrote a function that tracks the ratio of taps to swipes and changes the screen background in response.
This function needs to be refactored - there is definitely a more elegant way to write it.
